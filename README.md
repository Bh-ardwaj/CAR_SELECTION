# Car Accessories & Colours Probability Explorer ðŸš—

## Overview
This project is a **Flask-based web application** that allows users to explore car customization trends. Users can select a car model and see:

- **Overall probabilities** of people choosing each accessory and color.
- **Subset probabilities** (main feature), showing which accessories and colors are likely to be chosen together.

The **subset probability analysis** provides insights into co-occurrence patterns between car modifications, helping users understand popular combinations beyond individual choices.
